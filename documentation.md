Thesis: Homelessness

 I. Documentation

1. Wireframes
Located in the wireframes folder. 

2. Color Choices
 I chose various shades of purple while hovering through nav links etc. as purple is the awareness color that represents homelessness. I also chose a purple sparkle wallpaper because even though homelessness may be a raw and upsetting issue, there is still some hope to help; some sparkle. According to Personalized Cause, [Reference (1)] the awareness week for the homeless and the hungry lies usually during the week before Thanksgiving as it is the perfect time to remember that many of us are blessed to have a roof over our heads and bread to eat. The week in the month of November that is dedicated to the hungry and homeless, draws attention to the problem of poverty and raises hope in working towards a world without this sorrowful issue.

3. Accessibility
Web Accessibility means ensuring that there are no barriers for people with disabilities while using websites. With correctly designed websites, access to information and functionality would be equal to all people. Web accessibility is said to be a requirement by law. Since the world wide web is used as a resource for education, health care, government related areas, employment etc., it is one of the priorities for most companies and organizations in today’s era. Web accessibility includes disabled people, older people, others in developing countries and in rural areas in the internet world.  
In the most minimal manner, I have tried to make the website accessible by using headings with their appropriate sizes along with their placement. I also included an ‘alt text’ for all images used. I made the links have a highlight while hovering over it so that their distinguishable from other text. 

4. GDPR
While reading about the ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ I gathered a few important points such as: 
•	The GDPR works to reserve the rights of every individual’s personal data and his/her identity while putting in personal details for a certain company/organization. 
•	It is meant to discard any misusage of personal data and to build trust between people and the organizations or companies or anything that they sign up for. 
•	To respect one’s fundamental right to privacy. 
From reading ico.org.uk website, the GDPR does apply to me as my webpage that includes a “Donation Form” which involves recipients’ personal data and information. Hence, I am “processing” since I chose to collect data and am the ‘controller’ in this case.

Important points about the 8 individual rights summarized: 

People have the right to be informed about the collection and usage of the data they are providing including the purpose for processing their data, who else will share this data, etc., and hence require gaining utmost transparency with an organization they are dealing with. Individuals must be informed (privacy information) within a period of one month, if an organization is obtaining personal data from other sources except for when individuals already have this privacy information or if it requires a disproportionate effort to provide it to them. Regular reviewing and updating of privacy information is a necessity, any new use of one’s personal data must be informed to them before processing. Gaining feedback on how effective one’s delivery of privacy information by user testing is recommended. All information provided to people has to be accurate and transparent and in simple language. Building a trust relationship with clients online will help adhere to GDPR, otherwise one might have to face the consequence of reputational damage and fines.

 I did add a very basic ‘Privacy Policy’ section on the “Donation Form” page to ensure trust in sharing information and confirming no misusage of any personal data that would be sent in. 

5. Distance Selling
Distance selling (no more applies in UK law) was meant to protect consumer rights. It set out regulation information that a seller required to give on any goods or services they were offered. For example: what kind of goods, price of it, any delivery charge involved, duration of a contract for a service and information on the seller. This involved details of any ‘right to cancel’ and details of responsibility of both parties while returning goods. The expense of returning goods would always be the sellers. 
In my website, there is no such selling rather more of gaining (donation). The website does not provide any goods or services and hence did not have to comply on any rule related to distance selling.

6. Evaluation
 I have been keen on the issue of homelessness for quite some time. Without resources there was not much I could do except for donating to charities that go out and help those on the streets with donated food and money. When I was in New Mexico, USA, I supplied one of the organizations with food and other clothing supplies and received a certificate of appreciation for the same. I used this topic in my capstone project too. I have been donating for a very long time in my life. 

This time, I decided to approach those we find here in and around Southampton. Though there might be issues other than financial, for the homeless, like excessive drug usage etc., I still believe and have hope for the betterment of this minority. I dwelt on these external issues on the website. Each of those I approached had their own story to tell which I did document on the website. I further researched and put out facts that were alarming and possible measures that could be taken. Though a Tesco meal deal may be a very small gesture, it did make the men's days or at least brought a smile on their faces. Neither of them wanted to take a picture and so I respected that. But I did take a picture of the food in the bag (when I was giving it to the second man) and that is in the wireframes folder just to support the experience I had.

I encountered various issues during the whole process of working on this website. Starting from git to the actual website styling. I did struggle to properly place text across a webpages for days. However, in the process of this struggle I did learn a lot more than I already know. I learnt to use opacity, columns, google fonts, social media icons and a lot more. I did try making the website responsive; however, I was not successful even though it is a major part of this assignment. On the homepage I used the login pages links of all social media accounts as a demonstration. I used <h4> instead of <p> on the "About" Page, so that the font color is not as light as what it would have been with the <p> tag. I experimented well with JavaScript and enjoyed making a Donation Form for the website. The point of the form was so that this organization (or in this case, me) would receive an individual’s reason to donate, their personal details etc., and I would then personally contact them to make a payment. Although, I am aware that this method is probably not feasible on a larger scale.)

The design was fully based on my ideas and imagination. I looked up various websites and would even observe ones that I would scroll through daily to see their web layout and would try and fetch ideas. I felt quite restricted and frustrated when it came to designing as I would picture it to be one that looked great but it would mostly turn out to be child-like. However, after various changes over time I finalized on this one.
