    <h2>Reasons for Homelessness</h2>
    <h5>Why are there such large numbers when it comes to homelessness? </h5>
<div id= "buttons"> 
        <ul>
        <li> <h4> 1) Poor physical or mental health problems, alcoholism and drug issues, bereavement, crimes are individual factors that make people more vulnerable to homelessness. </h4></li> 
      
        <li><h4> 2) Poverty, housing supply and affordability, unemployment, income policies can stand as structural factors that cause poverty.</h4> </li> 
        
        <li><h4>3) Both the above factors are interrelated. Individual factors can arise from structural factors and vice versa. Poverty or lack of education can cause individual factor issues while poor working skills, inability to work at one's best capacity due to personal issues (individual factors) may lead to employment being at risk. Hence the two are related and can unfortunately lead to being on the streets. </h4> </li>
      
        <li><h4> 4) Homelessness impacts individuals and communities in many ways. Since it brings in feelings of isolation, chances of taking drugs or experiencing major phsyical and mental health problems becomes a greater possibility.</h4></li>
     
        <li><h4> 5) It is also known that the longer a person struggles in the position of being homeless, the harder it is to get back on their feet. Involvement in crimes and anti-social behavior becomes more likely.</h4></li>
     
        <li><h4> 6) Homeless people are likely to sleep rough, be involved in street drinking, beg, indulge in prostitution. </h4></li>
