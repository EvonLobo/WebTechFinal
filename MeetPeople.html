    <h2> My Experience In Southampton!</h2> <h4>I went to the city center street of Southampton to find someone I could share some food I bought from Tesco; nothing great just two tesco meal deals which included a sandwich, a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps. There were quite a lot of homeless people and I decided to share food with the man right outside Tesco. He accepted the meal deal with a smile on his face and I went on to ask him about all that he is probably currently experiencing. He began saying that living on the streets is hard, it gets cold and people do not notice. He mentioned he has a few friends around but they are never reliable. He said he likes when people give food but that's about it. He seemed quite reserved and not the type who would want to sit and have a conversation about it. In the middle of our talk he said he has to go, but I know he did not have to. I thought maybe he felt personally attacked or watched so I proceeded to leave and find someone else to share the second Tesco meal Deal.</h4>

    <h4>I did find another man sitting right outside West Quay. I approached him with the meal and he asked if he could borrow the bag too, and without hesitation I gave the bag I had. He accepted the food with a smile on his face and seemed grateful. I asked him about his experience too and he was pretty straightforward. He said he'd probably sit out there for 10 hours and have nothing but a lot of times he has had greater experiences with people who seem to sympathize with his situation. He said the council gives an appointment date and that takes too long and the 200 GBP they receive is no use (not sure why) but he began speaking of hostels that accomodate them that take money off of them. His speech wasn't clear but he said he feels dejected and lonely and tries his best to survive. </h4>

    <h4> I decided to talk to two people and share a smile with both! Neither of them wanted to take a picture, and I completely respected that and hence have no pictures. As an individual I think it is important for us blessed ones to be understanding towards those around us. Some people may choose the life they're living and some may not but I believe in doing good without discriminating according to the choices they made and their past because I have the capability to spend time or even just share a packet of crisps, which is really not all that hard. I hope we learn to not be ignorant and at least learn to share a smile with those less fortunate! </h4>
